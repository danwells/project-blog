# BLOG PROJECT 
## For Omaha Code School

This project is the first major exercise in integration of web development skills.  The work includes performing research into the requirements for a blog and a plan for how to build it.  Once the plan is approved by the instructor, work will then proceed to implementation of the blog using **Ruby** (for complex coding functions), **Sinatra** (for web server functions), **ActiveRecord** (for smart database manipulation), and the **MVC** (model-view-controller) design pattern for overall application construction.
